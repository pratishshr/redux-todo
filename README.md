# react-todo

https://pratishshr.github.io/react-todo/


This is a simple CRUD application that covers the basics of a react application.
It is made using plain React, without Redux (I'll make one later, maybe :P).

Things you will see:

* All of the CRUD operations  
* Routing with 'React-Router'
* Http calls with 'Axios'
* Throwing a spinner while fetching data
* Using forms and making controlled components
* And more...

Install all the packages

```
npm install
```

Start dev server

```
npm start
```
